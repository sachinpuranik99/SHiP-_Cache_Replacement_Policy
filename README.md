# SHiP++: Enhancing Signature-Based Hit Predictor for Improved Cache Performance

This repository contains a C++ implementation of SHiP++ [paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d1fb/26e6fc2c71d984bb1213af1d5b2a57f04b6f.pdf).

The code consists of the following
1. SHiP implementation
2. SHiP++ Improvements: 
      Insertion position,
      SHCT training policy,
      Writeback updates,
      SHCT training on prefetches and
      Prefetch updates
3. Some basic improvements to enhance the IPC.


The project won the fourth place in the CRC course [competition](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/djimenez/614/winner2.html) at TAMU Fall '17.
